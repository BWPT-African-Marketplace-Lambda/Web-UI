    <p>In daily practice, reflect on the benefits of love, compassion and kindness, then reflect on the disadvantages
      of anger. Such continuous contemplation, the growing appreciation of love, has the effect of reducing our
       inclination towards hatred and increasing our respect for love. By this means even anger can be diminished.</p>

    <h3>Title</h3>
    <p>We have bigger houses but smaller families. More conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees,
      but less sense. More knowledge, but less judgment. More experts, but more problems. More medicines,
       but less healthiness. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street
       to meet the new neighbor. We build more computers to hold more information to produce more copies than
        ever but have less communication. We have become long on quantity, but short on quality. </p>

    <h3>Title But Better</h3>
    <p>Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life,
       I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart
       out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind
       thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to
       benefit others as much as I can.</p>
