    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>Using this mobile service, traders with even an old school Mozilla Razor
      can access real time prices for the market along with exchange rates and any
       unknown trade procedures. Our service works with any kind of phone that allows
        SMS messaging to enhance the market place experience and make the trips easier
        for all involved. We want to help these cross-border traders in East Africa as much as we can.</p>

    <h3>Trade and Technology</h3>
    <p>Sauti's trade platform grabs information provided by our partnets to provide traders with the most recent and official information available. Our staff verify all out info, make the language easy and simple to understand, and translate it to allow further accessibility in all of East Africa. Let no language go untouched. Sauti's technology has so much potential and we plan to unlock it all. There is information relative to other information channels and the relatively low fixed costs of running the platform make it ideal to operate in rural areas. This is for the cross border folks out there.</p>

    <h3>This is for You</h3>
    <p>Sauti is the future. While currently, East Africa doesn't have such a wide spread amount of Wi-Fi, cellular signal is something that's more easily accessed. With this, we plan to make it easier for merchants to keep ahead of the prices and make sure everything is fair on both ends. No more will we stand for people to get swindled out of their hard earned right to be alive just because some hooligan lead them to believe the price of tomatoes was actually so low. This is for those folks. We're watching out for you. Text SAUTI to 55568 right now to sign up. Messaging and Data Rates will Not Apply, we're paying for it ourselves I bet.</p>
